	<p class="text-center"><strong>Nikola Tesla</strong> was an Serbian-American inventor, electrical engineer, mechanical engineer, physicist and futurist who is best known for developing the Alternate current (AC) induction motor, which revolutionised the way electricity was used, since the AC was easy to elevate to high voltages, making transportation a lot cheaper and easier. Later he developed the polyphasic alternatic current, know nowadays as the triphasic current, used in the entire world. </p>

        An induction motor or 3 phase induction motor is an AC electric motor in which the electric current in the rotor needed to produce torque is obtained by electromagnetic induction from the magnetic field of the stator winding.An induction motor can therefore be made without electrical connections to the rotor. An induction motor's rotor can be either wound type or squirrel-cage type.

        The Tesla coil is an electrical resonant transformer circuit.It is used to produce high-voltage, low-current, high frequency alternating-current electricity. Tesla experimented with a number of different configurations consisting of two, or sometimes three, coupled resonant electric circuits.

        hree-phase electric power is a common method of alternating current electric power generation, transmission, and distribution.It is a type of polyphase system and is the most common method used by electrical grids worldwide to transfer power. It is also used to power large motors and other heavy loads.
